# Sorting Visualizer

A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms. Built using React, this tool provides a comprehensive visual insight into the step-by-step procedures of various sorting methodologies.

Implemented Algorithms:

Bubble sort
Selection sort
Insertion sort
Merge sort
Quick sort
Heap sort
Features:

## Colored Representation:
Each step during the sorting process is represented with distinct colors:

Blue (default): Represents the default state of an array element.
Yellow: Represents the elements currently being compared.
Red: Indicates an element is identified as being in the incorrect position and needs to be moved.
Green: Marks an element that is correctly positioned.
Visualization Controls:
There are three main controls for tailoring your visualization experience:

## Speed of Visualization: Offers distinct speed levels, allowing users to adjust the pace of sorting animation.
Data Size Control: Users can modify the data size for a customized experience.
Data Regeneration: This control allows users to randomly generate new data for sorting.
Complexity Display:
For each sorting algorithm, the application displays the associated Time and Space complexities, aiding in understanding the efficiency and trade-offs of each method.

## React Integration:

The Sorting Visualizer uses React, a popular JavaScript library, to efficiently update and render the necessary components. The modularity of React components provides a clean and understandable code structure, facilitating easier additions and updates to the project in the future.
